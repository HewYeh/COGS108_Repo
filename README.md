# COGS108_Repo
This repository is created for a COGS 108 Assignment (A1) at UCSD

October 24, 2024: I cloned the repo and am now writing some edits on my local machine.

Wow this is really cool! I was able to clone using the Terminal in VS Code and also got Git through downloading XCode.

git version 2.39.5 (Apple Git-154)

.md files should also be able to handle non-latin characters.
汝好!我治只个文件內底塊拍字。

Ok that is enough yapping for now, let me see if I can commit this.
